docker run hello-world


To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.(amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal.

Docker daemon -- Background process	
---------------------------------------------------------


docker start containerid


Step 1 – Pull ubuntu image from docker hub

docker images

Step 2  - Run the image in interactive mode to make a container

	docker run -it ubuntu     

 

Step 3 Come out from the container with exit command 

 

Step 4 – Start a container 

	docker start <container ID>
	
docker start 083a48666e40

	

Step -5  logged into the bash of the  container 

	docker exec -it 083a48666e40 bin/bash

 

Step -6  Your container is ready to play any application try to install GIT in ubuntu container

apt update 	

apt install git-all 

apt install ansible

apt install python

docker run -it -d -p 80:80 nginx
	
	docker run --name docker-nginx -d -p 80:80 nginx
	
	
	docker rename practical_roentgen Avinash

Summary
This was a Docker training session (Day 2) focused on containerization fundamentals. The instructor, Cloud(Vikas), taught participants how to install Docker using a scripted approach, explained Docker architecture and workflow, and provided hands-on practice with basic Docker commands.

Key Notes
Docker Installation:

Used scripted approach via get.docker.com instead of manual apt install
Installed Docker version 29.2.1 (compared to 28.x from previous session)
Script works across all Linux flavors (Ubuntu, CentOS, Mint)
Docker Architecture & Workflow:

Docker client connects to Docker daemon
Daemon checks for image locally; if not found, pulls from Docker Hub
Daemon creates container from image
Output displays in terminal
Essential Commands Covered:

docker pull - downloads image only
docker run - downloads image and creates container
docker ps / docker ps -a - view running/all containers
docker images - list available images
docker exec -it [container_id] /bin/bash - enter running container
docker start [container_id] - restart stopped container
docker commit [container_id] - convert container to image
docker run --name [name] -d -p [host_port]:[container_port] - run with custom name, detached mode, and port mapping
Key Concepts:

Docker Hub: Public/private registry with 6.3M+ repositories
Container lifecycle: run → exit → start → exec
-it flag: interactive mode for container access
-d flag: detached mode (runs in background)
Port mapping required to access containerized applications externally
Containers are lightweight; installing packages increases size significantly

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Docker Scenario-Based Q&A
1. Scenario: Container exits immediately after running

Problem: You run docker run ubuntu but container stops right away
Solution: Ubuntu container has no foreground process. Use docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash to keep it interactive, or run with a service like docker run -d nginx
2. Scenario: Cannot access application running in container

Problem: Nginx is running in container but can't access via browser
Solution: Use port mapping: docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx, then access via localhost:8080
3. Scenario: Need to install packages in existing container

Problem: Container is running but missing required tools
Solution:
Enter container: docker exec -it [container_id] /bin/bash
Install packages: apt update && apt install [package]
Save changes: docker commit [container_id] new_image_name
4. Scenario: Too many stopped containers cluttering system

Problem: docker ps -a shows many exited containers
Solution: Remove stopped containers with docker rm [container_id] or use docker container prune
5. Scenario: Want to reuse container with custom name

Problem: Need to identify containers easily
Solution: Use docker run --name myapp -d nginx instead of random names.

Practical Exercises Performed in Today's Session
1. Docker Installation Using Script
Created Ubuntu VM on Google Cloud
Used scripted approach from get.docker.com
Installed Docker version 29.2.1
2. Basic Docker Commands
Pulled Hello World image: docker pull hello-world
Ran first container: docker run hello-world
Checked running containers: docker ps and docker ps -a
Listed images: docker images
3. Working with Ubuntu Container
Pulled Ubuntu image: docker pull ubuntu
Ran in interactive mode: docker run -it ubuntu
Installed packages inside container:
Updated packages: apt update
Installed Python: apt install python3
Exited and restarted container: docker start [container_id]
Re-entered running container: docker exec -it [container_id] /bin/bash
4. Container to Image Conversion
Created custom image from modified container: docker commit [container_id]
Verified new image in docker images list
5. Nginx Web Server Deployment
Pulled Nginx image: docker pull nginx
Ran Nginx with port mapping: docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
Accessed Nginx via browser on port 8080
Ran container with custom name: docker run --name [your_name] -d -p 8080:80 nginx
6. Container Lifecycle Management
Started stopped containers
Renamed containers
Managed containers in detached mode using -d flag

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on the meeting transcript, here are the interview questions and answers discussed:

1. What is Docker?
Answer: Docker is an open-source containerization platform tool that converts application code with binaries and its dependencies, making it lightweight, portable, and environment-friendly. With Docker, we can build, refine and ship images from one environment to another in containerized form.

2. What are containers?
Answer: Running image is known as container.

3. Difference between Docker Pull and Docker Run?
Answer:

Docker Pull: Only downloads the image from Docker Hub
Docker Run: Downloads the image (if not available locally) and also creates and runs the container. It performs both pull and execution.
4. What is Docker Hub?
Answer: Docker Hub is a registry where all the images are maintained. It has around 6.3 million public repositories. We can pull and push images from there. It can be used for personal or professional/company purposes.

5. Docker workflow/architecture - Explain what happens when you run a Docker command?
Answer:

Docker client connects to Docker daemon
Docker daemon checks if image is available locally. If not, it pulls the image from Docker Hub
Docker daemon creates a new container from the image
The container runs and output is visible in the terminal
6. What is Docker daemon?
Answer: Docker daemon is a background process that manages Docker containers and images.

7. Difference between docker run -it and docker exec -it?
Answer:

docker run -it: Used for first time when creating and running a new container in interactive mode
docker exec -it: Used to access an already running container in interactive mode
8. How to convert container to image?
Answer: Use docker commit command with container ID to create an image from a container.

9. What is NGINX?
Answer: NGINX is an open-source web server used for reverse proxy, caching, load balancing, and media streaming. It is a very popular web server with around 15 million applications running on it.
